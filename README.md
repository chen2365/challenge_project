# Are Artists and High-end Groceries to Blame for Gentrification?

In this project, I will study how two interesting factors, high-end groceries (such as Whole Foods market) and artistic migration, affect the housing price in New York City. We will take into consideration some other factors such as the location of subway station when conduct analysis. In addition, I will propose some models for predicting the most-likely next location for the artistsâ€™ migration or high-end grocery in order to provide some forward guidance for real estate investors from different angles.     
In New York City, the old refrain goes a little something like this:  Artists move into a neighborhood, make it cool, get pushed out by rising housing price as the result of the area desirability increases, artists find another place to settle-and on that cycle goes. A classic case of artist-led gentrification is SOHO. It is well-known that artists migrating from SOHO in Manhattan to Williamsburg in Brooklyn during the past 10 - 15 years. The housing price in Williamsburg recorded a dramatic increase over the past 5 - 10 years.
In addition, I believe homes near high-end grocery also worth more and appreciate faster for the reason that it is a strong indicator that the neighborhood is desirable, perhaps up-and-coming, and definitely improving.

First we show two preliminary PLOTS here:
* Percentage avg price/sqrt incrase from 2010 to 2016 for two regions: SOHO/Chelsea and Williamsburg. The expectation is housing pricing in Williamsburg incrase significant faster than SOHO/Chelsea in the past 10 years
* The comparison for avg price/sqrt between two regions:
  1. Whole manhattan except Harlem. We exclude Harlem here because the housing pricing in the area is not been considered comparable            with areas below(for example below 110th street on the west side and 96th street on the east side) it.
  2. Average price only account for the communities (zipcode) which has Whole Foods Market
