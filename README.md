# Are Artists and High-end Groceries to Blame for Gentrification?

In this project, I will study how two interesting factors, high-end groceries (such as Whole Foods market) and artistic migration, affect the housing price in New York City. We will take into consideration some other factors such as the location of subway station when conduct analysis. In addition, I will propose some models for predicting the most-likely next location for the artistsâ€™ migration or high-end grocery in order to provide some forward guidance for real estate investors from different angles.     
In New York City, the old refrain goes a little something like this:  Artists move into a neighborhood, make it cool, get pushed out by rising housing price as the result of the area desirability increases, artists find another place to settle-and on that cycle goes. A classic case of artist-led gentrification is SOHO. It is well-known that artists migrating from SOHO in Manhattan to Williamsburg in Brooklyn during the past 10 - 15 years. The housing price in Williamsburg recorded a dramatic increase over the past 5 - 10 years.
In addition, I believe homes near high-end grocery also worth more and appreciate faster for the reason that it is a strong indicator that the neighborhood is desirable, perhaps up-and-coming, and definitely improving.
